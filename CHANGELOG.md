# Changelog

## 6.0.0 (14-Nov-23)

* **Breaking change**: drop support for Ruby < 3. If you need to support older Rubies, stay on v5. If you'd like to support *even older stuff*, v4.5.0 is your choice as it plays nicely with Rails 5.1 and Ruby 2.5.
* Test only with Rails 7
* Fix some failing tests, minor tweaks

## 5.0.0 (14-Dec-21)

* Add support for Rails 7.
* Test against Rails 6.1 and Rails 7.0.
* Test against Ruby 3.0.
* Rails 5.1 is not supported officially anymore (but should still work fine).
* Ruby < 2.7 is not supported anymore (has reached end of life) but should still work.

## 4.5.0 (21-Sep-20)

* Added a new [`HttpOnly` option](https://github.com/jsanders/angular_rails_csrf#httponly-cookie) (thanks, [@Lubo-mir](https://github.com/Lubo-mir))
* Introduced some code refactorings

## 4.4.0 (04-Aug-20)

* Make the gem play nicely with controllers that do not have `protect_against_forgery?` method defined â€” for example, certain Doorkeeper controllers (thanks, [@amenz](https://github.com/amenz))
* Updated dependencies and cops

## 4.3.0 (18-May-20)

* Ruby version 2.4 is no longer officially supported (though it still should work) - this is also due to the fact that [v2.4 is abanoded by Ruby core team as well](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2020/04/05/support-of-ruby-2-4-has-ended/). Required Ruby version is now 2.5+ according to [version compatibility](https://github.com/jsanders/angular_rails_csrf/wiki/Version-Compatibility).
* Dropped backwards compatibility with older versions of Rails (v4 and below). [If you require Rails 4 support, use angular_rails_csrf v3]((https://github.com/jsanders/angular_rails_csrf/wiki/Version-Compatibility)).
* Increased test coverage up to 100%.

## 4.2.0 (31-Mar-20)

  + This option is introduced to comply with the latest changes: https://www.chromium.org/updates/same-site
